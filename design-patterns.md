# Design Patterns

#senior-engineer 

There are a plethora of Design Patterns in programming that tend to be common place and I want to be able to understand what these patterns are, how to implement them and when to implement them. Design Patterns are usually split up into 3 Categories: Creational Patterns, Structural Patterns, and Behavioural Patterns. Below is the full list of Design Patterns that I wish to understand, I will add explinations of each along with references to where I learned about them and also examples of implementations of each that I have created to show progress on my understanding of each one.

## Creational Patterns

### Abstract Factory

### Builder

### Singleton

### Prototype


## Structural Patterns:

### Adapter

### Bridge

### Composite

### Decorator

### Facade

### Proxy
