# Scope Management

#project-management

Having a good understanding of project scope and how to manage it seems like something that would be beneficial to me in my Career Development. Especially if at some point in my Career I decide to work on a solo project. Managing my time, expenses and the project scope would be essential in completing that project. I want to soak up as much of this understanding as possible while working with larger teams to maximise the lessons I can learn from these projects.
