# Estimations

#project-management

Estimations are a common part of software development. Being able to estimate precisely and consider all the possiblities when doing so is a valuable skill that I have already begun developing. I want to make sure that I can keep on top of this skill so that my estimations are as precise as possible and so that I can minimise surprises when working on projects.
