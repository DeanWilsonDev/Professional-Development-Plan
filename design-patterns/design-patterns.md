# Design Patterns

#senior-engineer 

There are a plethora of Design Patterns in programming that tend to be common place and I want to be able to understand what these patterns are, how to implement them and when to implement them. Design Patterns are usually split up into 3 Categories: Creational Patterns, Structural Patterns, and Behavioural Patterns.

The book `Game Programming Patterns` by Robert Nystrom extends this list with additional patterns relevant to games with three new categories: Sequencing Patterns, Decoupling Patterns, and Optimization Patterns. As well as extending the Behavioural Patterns with three additional patterns: Bytecode, Subclass Sandbox, and Type Object.

Below is the full list of Design Patterns that I wish to understand, I will add explinations of each along with references to where I learned about them and also examples of implementations of each that I have created to show progress on my understanding of each one.
