# Senior Engineer

#senior-engineer

Now that I have reached mid level engineer, I need to start thinking about which areas I need to expand my knowledge on in order to move up to Senior Engineer. While I still need to get a few more years of experience under my belt it pays to take note of the areas that I think a senior should have a firm grasp in and make sure that I am on the right track in those areas.

Some of these areas include:

[Understanding of Design Patterns](./design-patterns/design-patterns.md)
[Performance and Profiling](./performance-and-profiling.md)
[Development Practices](./development-practices/development-practices.md)
[Technologies](./technologies/technologies.md)
